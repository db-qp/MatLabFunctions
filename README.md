# MatLabFunctions

In the repo, I have multiple different matlab programs that all perform different functions.

columnproduct: takes two matrices and produces the product by columns as the output matrix
myrowproduct: takes an input matrix, A, and a vector, x, to calculate y for each row where y = Ax.
