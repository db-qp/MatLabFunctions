# MatLabFunctions

In this repo, I have multiple different matlab programs that all perform different functions.

columnproduct: takes two matrices and produces the product by columns as the output matrix
myrowproduct: takes an input matrix, A, and a vector, x, to calculate y for each row where y = Ax
rowproduct: takes two matrices and produces the product by rows as the output matrix

Note: for the excerises below, the picture associated with each exercise is the result the code produces.
exercise1: uses a shear transformation matrix to shear the original matrix 3 units in the vertical direction
exercise2: applies a shear transformation and rotation of 30 degrees counterclockwise to the original matrix
exercise5: applies a reflection matrix to the original matrix and displays the line of reflection
